Random notes about setting up Drupal
====================================

Site e-mail address is a System address >> used as sender for system related messages (reset password etc.)
 >> needs to have the same domain as the site domain > If not, it will end up into spambox

!!! Origin domain and site email address domain need to match !!!

Open the project in 2 different browsers
    1. As logged in user/admin 
    2. Anonymous user

!!! Make sure your core code is up to date !!!

USER 1
------
* Allmighty user in the site (can do anything, including harm)
* Username should be something gengeral (not tied to you as individual) & Something unique (hard to quess)
* Can't be deleted
* For administrating the site, create another user

HOMEPAGE
--------
* Articles will automatically display in the homepage 


ERROR HANDLING
--------------

* Default searchpage URL: /search/node (One option to replace 404 error page)


TRUSTED HOST SETTINGS (Removing the error notification)
---------------------
* Go to Settings.php
* Copy "Trusted host configuration" example code:

        $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = [
        '^www\.example\.com$',
        ];

* Paste to end of the file
* Change the path to be the correct path for running the site
