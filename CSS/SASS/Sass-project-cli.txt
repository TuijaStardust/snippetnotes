-dev = package used for development (not on the online site)
-w = watch - the script is re-run whenever changes are made 
-g = install globally

----- CLI COMMANDS 

# First thing to do in a new project: Create a package.json file
npm init 

# Install node-sass to project folder 
npm install node-sass --save-dev 

# Create sass files (.scss) inside sass folder 
touch main.scss 

# Add script to package.json to compile sass into css 
"compile:sass": "node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.css -w"
