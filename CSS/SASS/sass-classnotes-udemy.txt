# WHAT IS SASS AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

    Sass is a preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language

                        Sass
                      Compiler    
    SASS SOURCE CODE ---------> COMPILED CSS CODE

- VARIABLES: 
    For reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc.

- NESTING: 
    To nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code

- OPERATORS: 
    For mathematical operations right inside of css 

- PARTIALS AND IMPORTS: 
    To write css in different files and importing them all into one single file 

- MIXINS: 
    To write reusable pieces of css code 

- FUNCTIONS: 
    Similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can be used 

- EXTENDS: 
    To make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them 

- CONTROL DIRECTIVES: 
    For writing complex code using conditionals and loops 

- 2 Different sytaxes; sass and scss 

# ARCHITECTURE

- The 7-1 Pattern 
    - 7 different folders for partial Sass files and 1 main Sass file to import all other files into a compiled CSS stylesheet 
    - The 7 folders:

        |__ base        - Basic project definitions
        |__ components  - 1 file/component
        |__ layout      - Overall layout project 
        |__ pages       - Styles for specific pages 
        |__ themes      - To implement different visual themes 
        |__ abstracts   - Code that doesn't output css; variables, mixins, extends, functions
        |__ vendors     - 3rd party css
