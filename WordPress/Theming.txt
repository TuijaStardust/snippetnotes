#Required files

#There are only two files absolutely required in a WordPress theme:

index.php – the main template file
style.css – the main style file

---- TEST DATA

# Download a package of test data for making sure the theme support all the basic WordPress data types
https://themetest.wordpress.com/

# Listing of WP data types
https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test

---- DEBUGGING

# Debugging PHP constants are located in wp-config.php file
# These debug tools are meant for local testing and staging installs, not for live sites.

# WP_DEBUG 
# This allows you to view errors in your theme. 

define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );    // Toggle OFF
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );     // Toggle ON

# WP_DEBUG_LOG
# This is a companion to WP_DEBUG that causes all errors to also be saved to a debug.
# log log file inside the /wp-content/ directory. This is useful if you want to review all notices
# later or need to view notices generated off-screen

define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true ); // Toggle ON (true) / OFF (false)

# WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY
# This is another companion to WP_DEBUG that controls whether debug messages are shown inside the HTML of pages or not. 
# The default is 'true' which shows errors and warnings as they are generated. Setting this to false will hide all errors. 
# This should be used in conjunction with WP_DEBUG_LOG so that errors can be reviewed later.

define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );    // Toggle ON (true) / OFF (false)
