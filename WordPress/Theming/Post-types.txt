# About creating custom post types in plugins:
https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/post-types/registering-custom-post-types/

# Theme Developers can display Custom Post Types in any template file, often by using multiple loops.
# While you generally won’t develop Custom Post Types in your theme, you may want to code ways to display Custom Post Types that were created by a plugin.  
# The following templates can display Custom post types:
single-[post-type].php, archive-[post-type].php, search.php, index.php

Custom Post type templates

single-[post-type].php
# The single post template used when a visitor requests a single post from a custom post type. 
# For example, single-acme_product.php would be used for displaying single posts from a custom post type named acme_product.

archive-[post-type].php
# The archive post type template is used when visitors request a custom post type archive. 
# For example, archive-acme_product.php would be used for displaying an archive of posts from the custom post type named acme_product. 
# The archive.php template file is used if the archive-[post-type].php is not present.

search.php
# The search results template is used to display a visitor’s search results. 
# To include search results from your custom post type, refer to the code sample; (register_post_type(), is_post_type_archive(), post_type_archive_title())

index.php
# The index.php is used if a specific query template (single-[post-type].php, single.php, archive-[post-type].php, archive.php, search.php) for the custom post type is not present.
