# There are only two files absolutely required in a WordPress theme:

index.php – the main template file
style.css – the main style file

# Although a theme only needs a index.php template, typically themes include 
# numerous templates to display different content types and contexts.

# Template partial is a piece of a template that is included as a part of another template.
# Template partials can be embedded in multiple templates, simplifying theme creation.
