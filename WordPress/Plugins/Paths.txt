## Determining paths

- You should never use hard-coded paths in a plugin; 
    the proper way to access files in plugins is essential for ensuring compatibility with all WP installations  
- WP has a set of functions to determine the path to 'wp-content' and 'plugins' directories, as well as directories within plugins 

# Local paths 
   
plugin_dir_path()

    - extracts location relative to the plugins directory from its file name.
    - __FILE__ constant returns the full local server path to plugin directory

'''
<?php echo plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ); ?>
'''

- Referencing the local path to a file in a plugin subdirectory:
    >> use plugin_dir_path() with the subdirectory files 

'''
<?php echo plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . 'js/script.js'; ?>
'''

# URL paths 

plugins_url() 

    - Determines the full URL to any file in plugin directory 
    - 2 parameters: 
        - path relative to the plugins URL 
        - Plugin file you want to be relative to >> __FILE__ constant 

'''
<?php echo '<img src="' .plugins_url( 'images/icon.png', __FILE__). '">'; ?>
'''

# Other functions to determine URLs in WP 

admin_url()     - Admin URL 
site_url()      - Site URL for the current site 
home_url()      - Home URL for the current site 
includes_url()  - Includes directory URL
