# INITIALIZING LOCAL GIT 
git init 

# CLONING GIT REPOSITORY (First time only)
git clone [paste here the address from github]

# ADDING NEW FILE:
git add [filename or . for all changes]

# UNDO GIT ADD  
git reset
git reset [filename]

# COMMITING CHANGES
git commit -am"some message"

# PUSH ALL COMMITS TO GITHUB 
git push origin [branch name]

# PULLING
git pull origin [branch name]

# CREATING NEW BRANCH
git checkout -b [branch name]

# CHECKING OUT EXISTING BRANCH
git checkout [branch name]

# *if you cannot find it, do "git pull" and it should fetch new branches*
git pull origin [branch name]

# CHECKING BRANCH STATUS
git status

# Remove dead branches remotely
git push origin --delete [branch_name]

----

# MESSED UP SOME FILE?
# - Get a fresh copy from repo:
git checkout [filename]

# - Throw all your uncommited changes to garbage bin 
git stash

#  - OOPS! Get your stashed stuff back 
git stash pop

# REMOVE FILE FROM REPOSITORY BUT NOT FROM YOUR COMPUTER
git rm -r --cached [path/to/file/or/dir]

# SEE WHAT CHANGES YOU HAVE DONE BUT NOT COMMITED
git diff

# SEE LIST OF OLD COMMITS
git log

----

# Generating SSH key: 

# GENERATE NEW KEY
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your@email.com

# PRINT THE KEY
cat < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# Copy and paste the key to github (https://github.com/settings/keys)

# VERIFY IT WORKS
ssh -T git@github.com

# If it says
>> Hi [user]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.>>
# all is good
