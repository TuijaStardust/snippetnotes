WEEK 1. - WHAT IS A USER INTERFACE?
------

Design First Approach

Interface > UI / UX

What is user interface?

Design conventions include levels of flexibility

Interface is the bridge between user and the content

the interface (UI) shapes the experience (UX)

UI
- how it looks (interface)
- visual design
- form 
- aesthetics
- look & feels
- organization
- surface
- visual identity
- design driven


UX
- how it feels (experience)
- non-visual design 
- feel
- navigation 
- story 
- structure
- content 
- engagement
- user driven

user experiences form before content
designer experiences content before form 

Interface conventions
- real world knowledge >> analog models; buttons, menus
- learned behaviour (conventions)
- cause and effect (action/reaction)
- logic / familiarity / consistency (logic/systematic)
- fast (no unnecessary steps)/ seamless (easy)
- immediate intuition >> a few interactons teach a lot (know how button works > know how ALL buttons work)
- payoff / results / fulfillment >> expect something in return
- undo / redo / confirm >> Ability to fix everything

Preexisting modes of interacting
Preexisting interface conventions

"You don't want ti give them such a conventional interface that there is nothing INTERESTING or 
ENGAGING or ORIGINAL about that experience."

---
Physical conventions
- Hand / Eye / Body
- We interact different ways with different sized screens
- "keypad size in relation to size of our hand"

Digital conventions
- navigation on top of the screen (needs to have space for the menu to fall down)
- search > search icon
- hierarchy of the interface

READING: 
The 4 Golden Rules of UI Design by Nick Babich, Adobe Blog
10 Usability heuristics for User Interface design by Jakob Nielsen, Nielsen Norman Group website
Principle of consistency and Standards in User Interface design by Euphemia Wong, Interaction Design Foundation

In many ways template equals distilled versio of conventions
Template is good for repetitive similar kinds of content

Content Specific Design
"What is the best kind of interface possible for this kind of content
>> Context Specific Design

aesthetics + functionality = complete digital experience 

"specificity of any digital experience comes through the aesthetics of that experience whereas the 
functionality is coming from the interface conventions or the utility"

>> make object resemble something similar in physical life > shape, aesthetics, typography
OR 
We don't need to try and create something that physically looks like the element because we already understand
that everything on the screen is going to be interactive due to interface conventions that we're already
familiar with.

The aesthetic part of the interface design is about giving the interface a sense of individuality
The functional part of the interface design is about giving it some familiarity, ease of use.


WEEK 2. - FORMAL ELEMENTS OF INTERFACE DESIGN
------

A Brief: 
- outlines and describes the project before you begin designing
    >> goals
    >> constraints
    >> platform
    >> audience
    >>> KNOW YOUR PROJECT
- Describes what the project is, goals and how it's going to work 
    >> content, context and audience
- what it is we're goin to make
    >> what is it?
    >> who is it for?
    >> Where does it live?
    >>> PRE-DESIGN 

Style and mood of project 
>> ENVISION THE OVERALL DESIGN DIRECTION (Broad visual strokes)

Envison the design, image the design, try to give it a visual form even though it doesn't really exist
    >> What does it LOOK like?
    >> What does it FEEL like?
    >> How do you DESCRIBE it?

Language as a design tool - words as content
>> What kind of words might we use to describe it?
>> Use sets of words describing app as stepping stones in naming and branding
    > linguistic research and playing around with other words around the topic 
>> language can set the mood and the tone same way as visuals do, at every level throughout app 

Color & shape
>> Color as (overall) mood
BW -> Serious design
Yellow + black -> Danger
Bright color -> Fun 
Cool palette -> icy, cold feeling 
>> Real world and fabricated connotations
>> Figure out how to control the subjectivity and relativity to create the wanted athmosphere and mood
>> color can be used to create a system of difference and similarity 
>> color can signify an event or activity
>> using color to show progression

>> shapes are used two different ways
    > Interface Elements
        - primarily functional (part of a system)
        - Geometricly simple to understand -> easy to access
    > Design Elements
        - less systematic
        - motives
        - about look and feel
        - "non-essential" Elements
        - used to create graphic interface 
>> building a system that relates to the user and how they interact with the content
>> also building a flexible system, where we could label button anything we wanted to

Imagery 
>> content
    - framed content (boxes etc.)
    - contained and organized 
        * functional comparative structure
    - immersive imagery (part of interface university)

>> create a mood
    - non specific photography
    - visual fomr always has some style or aesthetics attached to it 
    - color, composition, visual aesthetics 

>> part of navigation 
    - often very reduced form
    - has to work a small size
    - has to be very recognizable

>> part of interface system 
    - when things you try to represent is very difficult to describe with words but easy to show with an image 
    - includes always also an aesthetic function (mood, tone)

"Everything has a form and because it has a form, it has an aesthetic value, it can create a mood.
Your content will always have mood and your navigation, or interface design will always have mood as well."

Typography 
>> content
    - text is language made physical
    - text is fast and accessible
    - text is accurate
    - text is economical
    - text can represent what cannot be depicted

>> interfarce
    - text has to have visual form - typographic representation
    - type is fast to read - no confusion
    - type can represent what cannot be depicted - f.e. democracy
      > words are great for the accurate representation of complex non-visual concepts
    - type is the fastest and most accurate way to communicate complex and specific ideas

>> brandind
    connotation + individuality = branding 
    - form of the type - Connotation 
    - "logotype and logo work together in harmony to form a single lockup"
    - creating an identity typographically
    - color dependence

"Language has a great deal of flexibility in terms how it works."

Icons 

- Visual representation in a small and condensed form where the user can recognize it.
- Icons look like the thing they're representing
- interface icons 
- Icon shows a (realistic) picture of the object ->  Pictorial
- Symbol is not an accurate representation of the thing it's representing -> non-pictorial
- image can work both as icon & symbol ->  magnifying glass - concept of searching (also zoom-in-zoom-out)
- in branding an image becomes the symbol that is representative of a company ->  Branding 
- ability to get value from both iconic meaning and the symbolic meaning
- symbolic meanings have to learned

"Goal is to combine what is known, what is visually obvious with what is learned."

Simple rules for good icon:
- Communication (ideas + aesthetics)
    >> what do you want your icon to communicate?
    -> Idea that communicates through its aesthetics as well.
- Functionality (technical)
    >> works different sizes, clear, legible
- Audience -> User gets it!
- Recognition (saturation + simplicity)
    >> simple, striking, memorable icon


WEEK 3. - ACTIVE ELEMENTS OF INTERFACE DESIGN 
------
Experience - Form - Function

"What do the elements do?"

>> How the interface is connected to its function or how it works
- Form is always connected to the function in some way 

SYSTEM
- (visually) predictable 
- economical 
- logical 
- expandable 

How Does The Interface Work?
LOGIC       |   INTUITION
HIERARCHY   |   DISCOVERY
SYSTEMATIC  |   LEARNING

How Do We Engage With The Interface?
THE KNOWN   |   THE UNKNOWN (intuitive learning by the user)
THE FAMILIAR|   THE NEW
FUNCTION    |   EXPERIENCE

Speed and Style 
- By reducing the graphic content of an interface and trimming it down to just its bare essentials, 
    you can create much faster level of accessibility for the user to get to the content. 

Speed:
+ Simple/direct 
+ Unambiguous 
+ Rapidly adoptable 
+ Familiar/predictable (simplicity, homogeneity)
+ Logical

- homogenous
- too familiar and predictable
- too unambiguous and logical
-> Boring experience 

Style: (experience of accessing content)
+ Entertaining
+ Engaging 
+ Reewarding Experience 
+ Brandable 
+ Novel/Individual 
-> Experience gives value

- Obstruct content
- Time-consuming
- Frustrating Experience
- Dates Rapidly 
- Unnecessary 
-> Creates frustration for the user 

>>> HOW DO YOU USE THESE ASPECTS TOGETHER? - SPEED AND STYLE 

"The best interface is the one that has the best relationship to its content, 
the one that's the most sympathetic. The best interface is the one that is visible and invisible 
at the same time, but in the right proportions. 

Composition and structure

"How you arrange the elements of the interface can really shape what kind of experience you want the user to have."

make a mock-up that looks like it actually works! 

functional content ->  content and the users priorities drive the composition
- visual hierarchy 
- using colors to bring out active information
- ancillary icons and symbols 
- familiarity (compared to other apps created for same functions)

>> When the basic structure has been already figured out there's no point in reinventing it.
    > improvements
    > aesthetic version

Emotion and experience  -> Content based on experience and exploration 
- image based interface 
- prioritazes experience, mood and tone.
- Has to be tried out by the user in order to be figured out - "learned experiental interface" 
- Creating strong indiosyncratic individual visual experience.
- meticulously controlled and composed imagery

Pattern Libraries

In graphic design terms, a pattern library is similar to a style guide or identity manual 
but applied to a website. It is basically a document outlining the overarching design for the website 
(or app) as well as all the elements within it.

The primary reason for creating a pattern library would be to ensure the UI stays consistent. 
(The first article digs into a few more reasons why a pattern library would be useful, 
especially for complex projects or within large organizations.) For the purposes of this course, 
however, please take a look at the second link to see some examples of other pattern libraries 
and style guides. It’s useful to get a sense of how other designers and design teams formulate 
a consistent UI across an entire site, and also the level of detail required when you have a lot 
of content at hand!

Buttons

>> A button is a self-contained object that is:
    - interactive 
    - you van click on or interact with 
>> It only works as a button if the user knows it's a button, not just a shape. 
>> familiar forms
    > size - cursor / finger / legible > How it's going to be used 
    > shape - function / label / screen
    > color - signifiers / system 
    > dimension - "trompe" l'oeil" (shadows and highlights to create fake dimentionality)
    > system - logic / placement 
>> Anything can be a button if the user knows it's a button > It has to be imediate knowledge for the user 
>> Clear labeling > User knows exactly what the button does (Remember also accessibility!)

Other navigational means of Interaction
- Simple
- Fast 
- Functional 
>> Design conventions are there for a reason > Use them when they are the best solution
    > Shape, Scale, Contrast, Clarity, Economy
    > Function
    > Aesthetics
    > Responsivity
>> Micro decisions all contribute to the look and feel of the interface.

Dropdown menu
    > Shape of box 
    > Scale of box 
    > Color of box
    > Relationship to main menu
    > Relationship to elements 

    > Typeface 
    > Weight / Size 
    > Leading / Case 
    > Color of type 
    > State Change 

>> INTERFACE DESIGN IS A RELATIONAL ACTIVITY
    > All of the different design decisions are all interconnected = Each design decision works in a relationship
      with every other design decision 
    >> COMPLETE INTERFACE

States and changes (states of existence)
    - Normal state - more visibility ->  contrats                   | Recognition
    - Hover state - less visibilitiy -> less contrast               | Confirmation
    - Press state - most visibilitiy -> contrast                    | Activation
    - Inactive state - least visibilitiy -> low contrast (ignored)  | Rejection

>> The element should look different enough to represent different states but similar enough so that
    they can belong to same family 

>> "You have to start to think about how your interface elements are going to animate."

WEEK 4. - COMPOSING THE ELEMENTS OF INTERFACE DESIGN 

Hierarchy of content - What goes where and why?

Hierarchy of function 
    - What's important to the user? 
    - What's not important to the user?
    - What are the things that they might not want to do straightaway?

Hierarchy of intention
    - What's important to the client?
    - What's the intention of the client?
    - Why are you making the website/app in the first place?

>> Ideally hierarchy of intention and hierarchy of function are the same.

"What's the first thing the user sees, because it's going to set the tone for the rest of their experience"

First things first
    - What's the first thing the user sees?
    - What's the user's first impression?
    - What's the first thing the user does?
    >> seeing, thinking and physically reacting

"The initial visual experience you give to the user is a foreshadowing of the rest of the experience they'll have on site"

>> When designing an interface, the first thing we're really doing is articulating the problem 
    and figuring out what is a good solution for that.

>> What is the best visual solution and what the main design elements are. What is the hierarchy of those elements 

Conventions and Expectations

"Our screens are often divided up in very conventional ways and as a user interface designers we have to 
figure out how to use these conventions."

Relationship of 4 self-contained area:
>> Content area is normally the most important in terms of scale and visual attention
>> Branding
>> Navigation 
>> Functionality

Simplest structural division:
    - Content that might change frequently
    - Elements that remain stable

"Where everything is laid out in front of us on a web page, on an app everything is hidden, or condensed or sequential."
    > Navigation is hidden until we need it

Web interface:
>> All out on display
>> Focus on multiple tasks


Phone interface:
>> Hidden until needed
>> When we travel to other screens, we want to do that in a fluid way; Swiping and scrolling
    - Menus coming from side with a swipe
>> Everything is packed away until you need that specific tool; nothing should get in the way of the small
    visual field that is our only place to show content 
>> Focus on sigle tasks

Structures & Grids / Platforms and Screen sizes

Computer screen
    - More real estate
    - Focus on multiple tasks
    - Single screen
>> More elements to organize 
    - Grids
    - Spacing
    - Scale 
    - Systems 
    - consistency
>> Design-centric process (big decisions)
    <header> Navigation </header>
    <body> Content - Grid; rows, columns, gutter, margins, image area (variables), caption area  </body>
>> A need to decide how images with other proportions are going to fit into image area
    - fill the width
    - fill the height
    - horizontal and vertical spaces are even
    - typesize in relation to text box
>> Readable type

Mobile screen
    - Less real estate
    - Focus on single tasks
    - Multiple screen
    - Smaller window on a much larger world

>> Before adding any images / information / real content:
>> Organizational decisisons and formal design decisions
    - figure out grid and system
    - scale
    - proportion of images 
    - captions 
    - spacing between images
    - Which pieces of information go where 

>> (Relative) Scale
>> Viewing Distance
>> Field of Vision

>> Both our phone and computer are windows to content, and they might be looking at the same thing
    but it's slightly different scales
>> Structural relationships between size & format 
>> Which size & format is the most important
    >> Mostly depends on content & function 
    >> WHO IS GOING TO USE IT?
    >> What platform are they going to use it in?
>> Increasingly it's going to be used and viewed on a small screen; handheld mobile device first and large computer screen second

Putting it all together

>> When designing prototypes UI and UX specialists often inform each other's work (not necessarily the same person)
>> Supplying a programmer (or yourself) with visual assets (and instructions) to create a working prototype

>> Creating a digital prototype
    - Many screens showing all the different stages of interaction
    - motion
    - engagement with the user 
    - the way interface is going to work can be a part of the plan without implementing them in these stages 
    - consistence through screens

>> Investigating 
    - the graphic design 
    - user interactions 
    - changes in the interface
