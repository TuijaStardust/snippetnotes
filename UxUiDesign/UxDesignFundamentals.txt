WEEK 1 - IDEATION, ARTICULATION, DEVELOPMENT

UX - How it feels (experience) >> non-visual Design
    > feel 
    > navigation
    > story
    > structure
    > content engagement (user driven)

"NOBODY WANTS ANOTHER APP THAT THEY DONT REALLY NEED!"

Where do GOOD ideas come from?
    > good problems > a REAL problems
        - problem that can be solved with an app
        - good focus
    > good process > solving the problem in a good way 
        - what is within that problem that you can solve with an app
        - how are you going to solve it
        - research
        - testing
        - revisions

        > articulate ideas clearly
        > test it with users and get feedback

IDEAS AND GOALS
    - Be as specific as you can be
    - Articulate your ideas clearly 
    - Expand and explore > all the different possibilities
    - Refine and edit > decide which possibilites are relevant

    Questions to ask:
    > What does it do?
    > How does it work? (How does it achieve its goal?)
    > Who benefits from it?
    > Why would someone use this?

    - Hierarchy Of Functionality 
        >> Hierarchy of ideas 
        >> Which function is the most important?
        >> Remember it and stick to it!
    
    >> The Big Idea
        - one-line description
            > My app... [fill in]
            > Think about how you use the language and tone to describe the app
            > No wasteful or extraneous language in words
            > Think about specifics of each word
        - minor (less important) ideas provide a supporting role
        
        - Does something similar exist?
            > solve that problem in a better or more engaging way

        - Who benefits from the app?
            > audience?
            > client?
            - Is it for fun?
            - Is it for social good?
            - Is it to make money?
        
        - Why would someone use the app in the first place?

    ANALYZING AN APP
        - What does the app do? 
            >> List out several functions of the app 
            >> Determine a hierarchy of function among them
            >> What is the primary/most important function?
            >> What are the secondary/less important functions? 
        - Review the primary/most important function
            >> Come up with a one-line description of the app based upon it 
        - How does the app work?
            >> How the app goes about achieving its goal
        - Who benefites from the app?
        - Who are it's potential users?
        - Why would someone use the app?
            >> goal & outcomes

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
    - Check out the competition
        > What apps exist that do exactly the same thing?
        > What apps do something similar?
            >> These apps might contain important information about what to do or what NOT to do with your app
            >> Screenshots of UI design
            >> Download the apps and go through them to actually experince them
            >> Note similarities that you want to repeat (or avoid)
        > What apps are content adjacent? (same broader subject matter)
            >> similarities in agenda?
            >> how to build a community of users around similar topic
            >> Information about idea or structure of the app (design, conceptual ideas, similar user philosophy)
            >> Stops research from becoming too predictable
        > What UNRELATED apps are structural models?
 
    - Developing the idea 
        > Think about the idea as being amorphous – blob or amoeba that can change its shape
        > Come up with a series of questions to help shape the idea:
            - What if the app is entirely image-based? etc...
        > Test idea and come up with a bunch of different options 
            >> map out the possibilities (the different ways the idea could be manifested)    
            >> test the water
            >> extend the parameters
            - What is special?
            - What is original?
            >> List EVERYTHING your app could do (empty your brain onto paper...)
                - Decide wheter they are good or bad ideas
                - Bounce idead off someone else / Talk to someone else (User feedback)
            >> Broadness comes from extending the parameters of thought
                - Open your mind 
                - Widen your scope

        > Examine ALL of the ideas
        > Decide precisely which of those ideas is the best – (Which idea to pursue)
        > Decide in what kind of order/hierachy to engage with the ideas

    MAP OUT THE POSSIBILITIES 
        - Consider the idea as an amorphous, unfixed entity 
            >> It shouldn't be a clear idea in your mind right now, and that's ok
        - Use a "what-if" strategy to build on the idea. 
            >> In what ways could the idea manifest or expand?
        - Don't censor yourself 
            >> You can always say NO to any possibility later
        - Map the idea out on paper with a pen
        - Bounce the idea off of a friend/family member
            >> What's their response?

        >> Repeat the process until the idea(s) become more refined

AUDIENCE AND RATIONALE (MOTIVATION)
"Who benefits from my app?"    
    - Might have overarching consequences for what the app does and how it works
    - Who is my audience? (Hard core user group)
    - Think of the audience from general approach to more specific
    - Look out for personality traits, lifestyle traits, inventive or creative traits etc...
    - 4 Categories of traits
        > Political
        > Social
        > Financial
        > Functional 
    - Invent profiles of typical/ideal users 
        >> "One-line user profiles" accurately describes users of the app
        >> Archetype/stereotype of an user (that everybody can understand)
    
"How might the defined audience help define the rationale/motivation why someone would use the app?"
    - Inventing users' concerns 
    - Using the same methods as when figuring out the audience; trait categories 

    >> User-centric concerns
    >> User centered Design 
    >> Design centered design 
    >> The goals and intentions of the client 

GOALS & OUTCOMES
"What are my goals?"
