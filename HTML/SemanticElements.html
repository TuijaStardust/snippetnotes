<!-- "How to use" guide -->

<address>
    <p>
    Address element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides 
    contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.
    </p>
</address>

<article> 
    <p>Article  element represents a self-contained composition 
    in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended 
    to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).
    </p>
</article>

<aside>
    <p>Aside element represents a portion of a document whose content is 
    only indirectly related to the document's main content. 
    Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes 
    </p>
</aside>

<audio>
    <p>
    Audio element is used to embed sound content in documents. 
    It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the
    src attribute or the <source> element: 
    the browser will choose the most suitable one.
    </p>
</audio>

<cite>
    <p>
    Citation element is used to describe a reference to a 
    cited creative work, and must include the title of that work. 
    The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to 
    context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.
    </p>
</cite>

<code>
    <p>
    Code element displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to 
    indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, 
    the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.
    </p>
</code>

<details>
    <summary>Summary about details element</summary>

    <p>Details elementcreates a disclosure widget in which information is visible 
    only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label 
    can be provided using the 'summary' element.
    <br><br>
    A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle 
    which rotates (or twists) to indicate open/closed status, with a label 
    next to the triangle. If the first child of the details element is 
    a summary, the contents of the summary element are used as the label 
    for the disclosure widget.
    </p>

    <p>
    Summary element specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a 'details' 
    element's disclosure box. Clicking the 'summary' element toggles the state 
    of the parent 'details' element open and closed.
    </p>
        
</details>

<figure>
    <p>
    Usually a 'figure' is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., 
    that is referenced in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved 
    to another part of the document or to an appendix without affecting 
    the main flow. 
    </p>

    <figcaption>
    Figure Caption element represents a caption or legend describing the rest 
    of the contents of its parent 'figure' element.
    </figcaption>

</figure>

<footer>  
    <p>
    Footer element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or 
    sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about 
    the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents. 
    </p>  
</footer>
      
<header> 
    <p>
    Header element represents introductory content, typically a group of 
    introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements 
    but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
    </p>    
</header>

<main>
    <p>
    Main element represents the dominant content of the 'body' of a document. 
    The main content area consists of content that is directly related to 
    or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality
    of an application.
    </p>
</main>

<mark> 
    <p>
    Mark text element represents text which is marked or highlighted for 
    reference or notation purposes, due to the marked passage's relevance 
    or importance in the enclosing context.
    </p>
</mark>

<nav> 
    <p>
    Navigation element represents a section of a page whose purpose 
    is to provide navigation links, either within the current document 
    or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, 
    tables of contents, and indexes.
    </p> 
</nav>

<section>
    <p>
    Section element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more
    specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document. 
    Typically, but not always, sections have a heading.
    <br><br>
    Do not use the 'section' element as a generic container; 
    this is what 'div' is for, especially when the sectioning is only for 
    styling purposes. A rule of thumb is that a section should logically appear
    in the outline of a document.
    </p>    
</section>

<time>
    <p>
    Time element represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime 
    attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for 
    BETTER SEARCH ENGINE RESULTS or CUSTOM FEATURES such as reminders.
    </p>
</time>
