-------------------------------------

# Make sure (latest version of) composer is installed globally

# Creating new project 
composer create-project symfony/skeleton [projectname]

# If using PhpStorm: ignore .idea directory from .gitignore

# Install also:
composer require server

# Command to run server (Quite ctrl+c)
./bin/console server:run

# List all ./bin/console commands 
./bin/console

# 3 Important Directories: 

# Public = document root where all publicly accessible files are (index.php)
#   index.php = "Front Controller" = the PHP file that is executed on every request

# Config = holds configuration files
 
# Src = source => my php codes

---

# Route = the configuration that defines the URL for a page 

# Controller = a function that we write that builds the content for that page 
               * A controller must return a symfony response object* 
---

# config/routes.yaml

''' 
index:
  path: /
  controller: App\Controller\DefaultController::index
'''

# index = internal name of the routes 
# when someone goes to homepage (/) it should execut index method in DefaultController class

# The namespace = for every class and source => App\whatever subdirectory it's in
