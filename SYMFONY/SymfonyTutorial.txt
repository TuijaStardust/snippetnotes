Sample files in repository:

-------------------------------------

# Make sure (latest version of) composer is installed globally

# Creating new project 
composer create-project symfony/skeleton [projectname]

# If using PhpStorm: ignore .idea directory from .gitignore

# Install also:
composer require server
composer require annotations
composer require sec-checker --dev // For development only
composer require twig 
composer require profiler --dev
composer require debug --dev       // Several packages related to one topic
composer require asset

# Command to run server (Quit ctrl+c)
./bin/console server:run

# List all ./bin/console commands 
./bin/console

# Unpacking "plugin" (=recipe) packs 
composer unpack [nameofpack]

--- RECIPES

https://flex.symfony.com

# symfony.lock -file keeps track of which recipes have been installed
# Recipes can add configuration files, create directories and modify files
# so the library instantly works without any extra setup.

# Logger
composer require logger

# Sending emails
composer require mailer

---
# 3 Important Directories: 

# Public = document root where all publicly accessible files are (index.php)
#   index.php = "Front Controller" = the PHP file that is executed on every request
#   css files, fonts and images (must be accessible to users browsers)

# Config = holds configuration files
 
# Src = source => my php codes

---

# Route = the configuration that defines the URL for a page 

# Controller = a function that we write that builds the content for that page 
               * A controller must return a symfony response object* 

--- ROUTING

# config/routes.yaml

''' 
index:
  path: /
  controller: App\Controller\DefaultController::index
'''

# index = internal name of the routes 
# when someone goes to homepage (/) it should execute index method in DefaultController class

# ==> Using ANNOTATIONS:
# Include the library in the controller file: 
  use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

# Add above controller method
'''
/**
 * @Route("/[path]/{slug}", name="something_descriptive")
 */
'''

---
# The namespace = for every class and source => App\whatever subdirectory it's in 

--- TWIG 

https://twig.symfony.com

# If your app needs to return HTML, one of the great tools is Twig.
# Creates 'templates/' directory for twig templates

# base.html.twig = Layout file
# BLOCKS in base-template are "holes" that you can fill with child-templates
# By extending it to other files, you get the basic HTML structure

# If you want to render a (twig) template, you need to extend a base class; 
# AbstractController 
# => Shortcut methods {
# return $this->render('[templatefilename.html.twig]'), [
# an array of variables I want to pass into the template]
# } 

# Twig syntax;
# {{ }} "say something" tag   // it prints 
# {% %} "do something" tag    // whenever you need to do something (loop etc.)
# {# #} twig comments 

# Twig documentation:
# Tags -> all the possible "do something" tags {% %}
# Functions = functions :)
# Tests 
# Filters = kinda like functions but more hipster :)

# Adding to a twig block:
'''
{% block awesome %}
    {{ parent() }}

    //stuff you want to add to this block instead of overwriting

{% endblock%}
'''

--- WEBPACK ENCORE

# Use asset() to wrap css-file references ( href="{{ asset('/css/styles.css')}}") 
# and image-references ( src="{{ asset('images/imagename.png') }}" )


--- GENERATING URLS 

# To get a listing of all the routes:
./bin/console debug:router

# To modify the name of the router (--> used in twig templates)
# add name property to a ROUTER (after path attribute)

# Define a value for {slug} <--"wildcard" value that needs to be defined in an article
# Add the name and slug-value into a twig file link:
# <a href="{{ path('something_descriptive', { slug: 'name-of-the-article' })}}">
