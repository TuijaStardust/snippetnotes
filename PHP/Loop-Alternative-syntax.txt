# PHP offers an alternative syntax for some of its control structures; 
# namely, if, while, for, foreach, and switch. 

# In each case, the basic form of the alternate syntax is to:  

change the opening brace to a colon -> : 
and the closing brace to endif;, endwhile;, endfor;, endforeach;, or endswitch;, 

# respectively.

# Mixing syntaxes in the same control block is not supported.
